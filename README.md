# Health Sciences Journal Theme

A Hugo theme that mirrors the appearance of an [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs) journal using the [health sciences theme](https://github.com/pkp/healthSciences).

# Features

The theme can replicate the journal front end, including homepage, tables of contents, and journal information pages. 

Article pages will:
* Show article details, including authors, abstract, funding, keywords, and references
* Provide the article's citation in 10 different options for in-browser display or for export in RIS, Endnote, Bib, and CSL-JSON formats.
* Allow for viewing for PDF and XML galleys using eLife lens
* Display the Crossmark logo

A small number of enhancements have also been made including:
* Lens viewer now includes the journal logo and a back button
* Homepage background images can be served in multiple resolutions to improve responsiveness
* Some citation display formats have been updated or adjusted, including MLA and Vancouver.
